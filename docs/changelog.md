# Changelog

## v1.0-beta2 (2021-04-04)

First improvements after user feedback - thank you Dietmar(@daust):

- Splitting level verbose into debug and trace (we have now error, warning, info, debug and trace)
- Remove method permanent (is now a attribute in all log methods)
- Overload all log messages (procedure and function returning log_id)
- Improved docs to reflect the changes

## v1.0-beta1 (2021-03-14)

- First official beta version for collecting feedback from other users.

## countless alpha and beta versions with many api changes ;-)

- The CONSOLE was in heavy development. Therefore I did not update the
  changelog.

## v0.1-alpha (2021-01-05)

- First functional code.
